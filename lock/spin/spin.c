/*
In Mutex concept, when thread is trying to lock or acquire the Mutex which is not available then
 that thread will go to sleep until that Mutex is available. Whereas in Spinlock it is different. 
 The spinlock is a very simple single-holder lock. If a process attempts to acquire a spinlock and 
 it is unavailable, the process will keep trying (spinning) until it can acquire the lock.
  This simplicity creates a small and fast lock.

Like Mutex, there are two possible states in Spinlock: Locked or Unlocked.
